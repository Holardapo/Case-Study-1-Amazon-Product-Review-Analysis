Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values Total Records: 1,465 rows TotalFields: 16columns
## Analysis Tasks & Findings
### Question 1: What is the average discount percentage by product category?
-Methodology: Create a pivot table with "Category" as the row label and "Discount Percentage" as the value field. Calculate the average discount percentage using the formula: `=AVERAGE(Discount Percentage)`
- Insight/Interpretation: The average discount percentage varies significantly across product categories. "Homeimprovement" products lead with the highest average discount (57.95%), followed closely by "Computers & Accessories" (55.24%), "Health & Personalcare" (52.68%), and "Electronics" (52.33%). This suggests aggressive pricing strategies or competitive markets within these categories. In contrast, "Toys & Games" are listed with no average discount (0.00%), and "Officeproducts" have a very low average discount (12.36%)
### Question 2  How many products are listed under each category?
Methodology/Approach: Utilized an Excel Pivot Table. 'Product Category' was placed in the Rows area, and 'product_name' was placed in the Values area, set to show the 'Count'.
- Insight/Interpretation: The product listing count changes across categories. "Electronics" dominates with 598 products, followed by "Home & Kitchen" with 448 products. These two categories represent the vast majority of products in the dataset, indicating they are core offerings for sellers. Conversely, several categories like "Car & Motorbike," "Health & Personalcare," "Toys & Games," and "Musical instruments" have only 1 or 2 products listed. This could suggest either niche offerings, unexploited market potential, or potentially incomplete data for these categories
### Question 3: What is the total number of reviews per category?
-Methodology:Create a pivot table with "Category" as the row label and "Number of Reviews" as the value field.Sum the number of reviews using the formula: `=SUM(Number of Reviews)`
- Insight/Interpretation: The total number of reviews per category dramatically highlights customer engagement levels. "Electronics" absolutely dominates with over 18.9 million reviews, reinforcing its position as the most popular and actively reviewed product category. "Home & Kitchen" follows as a distant second with nearly 3 million reviews.
### Question 4: Which products have the highest average ratings?
- Methodology:Create a pivot table with "Product Name" as the row label and "Average Rating" as the value field. Sort the products by average rating in descending order.
### Question 5: What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
-Methodology:Create a pivot table with "Category" as the row label and "Actual Price" and "Discounted Price" as value fields.Calculate the average prices using the formula: `=AVERAGE(Actual Price)` and `=AVERAGE(Discounted Price)`
- Insights:Electronics* has the highest actual and discounted prices, with a discount of around 42.5% off the original price.Home & Kitchen products have a substantial discount, with prices reduced by around 44% from the actual price.Toys & Games has no discount, with actual and discounted prices being the same. Overall, the total discount across all categories is around 43%, indicating a significant price reduction for customers.To further analyze this data, consider calculating the percentage discount for each category and identifying which categories have the highest and lowest discount
### Question 6: Which products have the highest number of reviews?
-Methodology:Create a pivot table with "Product Name" as the row label and "Number of Reviews" as the value field. Sort the products by number of reviews in descending order.
- Insight/Interpretation: The analysis of review counts by product name reveals the most popular and highly engaged products. "boAt" stands out with over 4 million reviews, making it the product with the highest customer engagement. Other products with a very high number of reviews include "Redmi", "AmazonBasics", "JBL", and "Samsung", each exceeding 1 million reviews.
### Question 7: How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
-Methodology:A calculated field or  column was created to categorize products based on whether their 'Discount (%)' was 50% or more (Yes/No). An Excel Pivot Table was then used to count the occurrences within these 'Yes' and 'No' categories.
- Insight/Interpretation: A portion of products, 497 out of 1084 (approximately 45.85%), are offered with a discount of 50% or more. This indicates that  half of the product listings are subjected to pricing strategies. This could be a response to high market competition, an effort to clear inventory, or a deliberate strategy to attract price-sensitive customers. The relatively even split between highly discounted and less discounted products suggests a diversified pricing approach by sellers on Amazon.
### Question 8: What is the distribution of product ratings?
- Methodology/Approach: Utilized an Excel Pivot Table. 'rating' was placed in the Rows area, and 'product_name' was placed in the Values area, set to show the 'Count
- Insight/Interpretation: The distribution of product ratings shows a  positive skewness, indicating  the majority of products have high ratings. The highest concentration of products falls within the 4.1 to 4.3 rating range, with 196 products at 4.1, 170 at 4.2, and 151 at 4.3. This highlights generally good customer satisfaction across the listed products. As ratings decrease, the number of products also significantly drops (e.g., only 28 products at 3.6).
### Question 9: What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?
Methodology:Create a calculated column using the formula: `=Actual Price * Rating Count`.Create a pivot table with "Category" as the row label and the calculated column as the value field.Sum the total potential revenue using the formula: `=SUM(Total Potential Revenue)`
-insights:Electronics: With estimated sales of 111,414,333,343, this category dominates the sales landscape, accounting for approximately 91% of the grand total. This suggests that electronics are in high demand, and the market is likely driven by technological advancements, new product releases, and consumer desire for innovative gadgets.Home & Kitchen With estimated sales of ₹ 10,459,722,337, this category is a distant second, accounting for around 9% of the grand total. This indicates a significant market for home and kitchen products, potentially driven by consumer spending on home improvement and renovation projects.In contrast, categories like Car & Motorbike,Health & Personalcare,Home Improvement, Toys & Games, and Office Products have relatively negligible sales figures, suggesting that these markets may be smaller or more niche
### Question 10: What is the number of unique products per price range bucket?
- Methodology:Create a calculated column using the formula: `=IF(Price<200, "<200", IF(Price<500, "200-500", ">500"))`.Create a pivot table with the calculated column as the row label and "Product Name" as the value field. Count the number of unique products using the formula: `=COUNT(DISTINCT Product Name)`
- Insight/Interpretation: The distribution of extensive products across price ranges reveals a clear focus on higher-priced items. A dominant majority of products, 961 out of 1084 (approximately 88.6%), fall into the "> ₹500" price bucket. Products in the "₹200-₹500" range are significantly fewer (97 products), and there are very few products in the "< ₹200" range (only 26 products).This suggests that sellers on Amazon, or at least within this dataset, primarily target the mid-to-high price segments
### Question 11: How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
- Methodology:Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between rating and discount.Calculate the correlation coefficient using the formula: `=CORREL(Rating, Discount Percentage)`
- Insight/Interpretation: Products with the lowest discount range (<10%) have the highest average rating (4.25). Conversely, products with the highest discount range (>50%) have a slightly lower average rating (4.03). The mid-range discounts (10–25% and 25–50%) fall in between, with averages of 4.15 and 4.08 respectively
### Question 12: How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
-Methodology:Create a calculated column using the formula: `=IF(Number of Reviews<1000, "Yes", "No")`. Filter the products with fewer than 1,000 reviews.
-Insights: Most products are either very affordable or high-end. The data shows a bimodal distribution, with 411 products priced above ₹10,000 and 247 products priced between ₹0-999.Mid-range products are less common.The number of products decreases as the price range increases from ₹1,000 to ₹9,999, with the fewest products in the ₹8,000-8,999 and ₹9,000-9,999 ranges (20 products each).Product distribution: The top two categories (0-999 and >10,000) account for approximately 61% of the total products (658 out of 1084), indicating a skewed distribution towards budget-friendly and premium products.This distribution might suggest that the market caters to both budget-conscious customers and those willing to invest in high-end products, with fewer options 
available in the mid-range segment.
### Question 13: Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
Methodology:Create a pivot table with "Category" as the row label and "Discount Percentage" as the value field. Calculate the average discount percentage using the formula: `=AVERAGE(Discount Percentage)`. Sort the categories by average discount percentage in descending order.
- Insight:"Homeimprovement" (57.95%), "Health & Personalcare" (52.68%), and "Electronics" (52.33%) are the categories where products carry the highest average discount percentages. This indicates they are highly competitive categories where sellers frequently employ  pricing strategies to attract customers or manage inventory.
### Question 14: Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.
- Methodology:Create a calculated column using the formula: `=Rating Number of Reviews`.Sort the product list by the calculated column in descending order. Select the top 5 products.
-insights:boAt is the top-scoring brand With a combined score of 4318.18, boAt leads the pack, accounting for approximately 39% of the total score (4318.18 / 11019.9).Redmi and AmazonBasics are strong contenders.
